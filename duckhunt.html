              Finally, after two weeks, the long awaited (for the impatient) Duckhunt 
              game returns! The much requested Duckhunt 2 is now out with all the 
              features you were missing. Duckhunt 2 is of the same concept as its 
              predecessor but with new design, new features and new levels. If you 
              wish to learn more about the game, all you need is on this page, but 
              for those who can't wait: you'll find the game at the bottom of the page.

            <h2>Game concept</h2>
            <p title="some absolute bs">
              A killer duck is on the loose and you have to stop it! It has stolen bunch of 
              precious red jewels and is considered armed and highly dangerous. Reports have come in 
              of explosives being encountered by people following the fugitive. Now everyone's 
              holding out hope for someone brave enough to catch this degenerate duck.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              So how does the game work? It can be broken down into three key pieces: listening to 
              user input, setting timers and generating randomness. If we begin with the last one, 
              everytime the duck is moved a new, random position will be generated for it to move to. 
              That is the main, and most basic, feature of the game. The other objects 
              are generated at random with based on a approximate probability (ex. 1 in 3). The randomness 
              is what keeps the game unpredictable and fun, but it wouldn't be any sort of challenging 
              if it didn't have some time pressure. That's where the timers come in. The timers are used to 
              set the game duration (so it doesn't go on until the end of time) as well as to make the 
              duck move after a certain time has passed. It also controls how long other objects are shown 
              and allows animations to play out before an object disappears. It's what makes the game feel alive, 
              but it's not dynamic without user input. User input is what makes it a game. User input includes 
              a lot of things, mainly changing the game settings and interacting with game objects, but also less 
              obvious things like resizing the window. The user effectively controls everything that happens in 
              the game (except for the randomly generated) and most of the code is just listening to the user 
              and acting accordingly.

            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <p>
              The game is very simple to play. At the bottom of this page you'll find the 
              'Play the Game' section. Press the 'Play' button under this section to open 
              the game window. You can at any point press the escape key to exit this window, 
              if your device has a keyboard that is to say. When opening the game you will 
              be greeted by the setup menu. Here you can choose the level to play and the 
              duration of the game. If you wish to further customize your experience you 
              will find additional options by pressing the 'Advanced settings' button. 
              The advanced options allows you to change the default configuration of a 
              level. When you're done with the setup press the 'Load' button to load the 
              game with your configuration. Then simply press the start button and begin 
              the game. Do your best to hit the duck as many times as you can before the 
              time runs out. Remember that the points you get depend on where you hit the 
              duck: a headshot gives three points, a hit to the center gives two points and 
              a hit on the edge gives one point. You can see your current score and time 
              left at the top right and top left corners of the window during the game. 
              After a game ends your score will be added to your personal leaderboard and 
              you can choose from the menu if you wish to play again, adjust the settings 
              or quit the game.

            <p>
              The new highscore feature is one that has been widely requested. 
              After every game run the score, level and time of entry is 
              recorded in a list so that you, as the user, can compare your runs. 
              The scoreboard will automatically clear out when you refresh the page. 
              This feature is to help keep track of your personal scores better and 
              makes it much easier to see and improve your own highscores. Now, we 
              are in the process of creating a global leaderboard, however, it's 
              going to take a while before that feature is ready to roll out, so we 
              have made a sort of personal leaderboard for the time being.

        <h3>Animations</h3>

            <h4>Intro</h4>
            <p>
              The game has an intro animation, it might look a little complicated at 
              first but it's actually quite simple. It uses the game logo, which is 
              just a normal png, and moves it around using keyframes. There's two of 
              the logo image on the page and each has a separate animation. The main 
              pictures animation is on the transform property and uses translate and 
              scale to 'move up' and 'enlarge' the image. It also has a transition on 
              opacity to make it fade in rather than pop up. The second image is the 
              one that makes the glitch effect. It's moved around with translate and 
              then becomes visible by changing the opacity, which creates 'glitch'. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col img-col">

          <div class="col">
            <h4>Outro</h4>
            <p>
              When the game closes, there's a short, subtle and simple animation there 
              to make it a nicer transition. The animation makes it look like the game 
              window is compressed from the top and bottom until it disappears. This 
              too is quite simple and do not use any keyframes to function. What happens 
              is: first the game window is positioned in the center of the page vertically. 
              Then a very thick black outline is added to the window, to hide the background 
              contents and make the window appear to be in a vacuum. Lastly a height 
              transition is added to element and the height is set to 1px.

            <h4>Duck</h4>
            <p>
              The default animation is for it to be brought out, squished, then fly away 
              spinning like a football. On touch devices the duck will have the same behaviour 
              as the diamond, see below. The default behaviour is controlled by keyframes. First 
              it's scaled up and rotated on the x-axis (horizontally on the screen) which makes 
              it appear squished. It's then rotated back, then scaled back to normal. It's then 
              decreased in scale and opacity and rotated around the z-axis (horizontally into the 
              screen) until it 'disappears'.

          <div class="col">
            <h4>Bomb</h4>
            <p>
              The bomb 'explodes', in a very loose interpretation of the word. The animation 
              is simple so the bomb just shrinks and then expands until it disintegrates.

          <div class="col">
            <h4>Diamond</h4>
            <p>
              The diamond uses the 'plop' animation as it looks like it sounds like that 
              (and it does with the sound effects). It is simply that the element gets 
              scaled up then scaled down into the void.

              Everytime the player hits the duck there's a one in three chance that the 
              duck will drop a red diamond. Their position is unpredictable, but if the player manages to collect it, 
              they will get 5 extra points. However, the diamond will not stay for more than a couple seconds and 
              is only half the size of the duck so it can be easy to miss when you're busy chasing 
              the duck.

              Whenever a player misses the duck with their shot there's a one in three chance that 
              the duck will notice and plant a trap for the player, an active bomb. The bomb will be defused after 
              a couple of seconds but if the player accidentally shoots it before that, it will blow up everything 
              on the map. If so happens the duck will use the confusion to steal back a point from 
              the player.

              Duckhunt 2 comes back with the brand new sound effects feature. Most interactions 
              the player has with the game will cause a sound to play. These sounds are placed on the html

              six sounds play: game opens, game closes, button pressed, duck hit, bomb exploded, diamond 
              collected, new highscore achieved. If your device has a connected keyboard you can mute and

              The game alerts when the duck is hit as well as when diamonds and bombs are planted and

              Duckhunt 2 is playable on computers as well as phones and tablets. To achieve this the 
              ducks size is dependent on the viewport width, page orientation and whether the user is using 
              a mouse or touch screen. The games bounds are reevaluated everytime the screen size changes. 
              There's a lot of css media queries to control how the game menus behave on different screens 
              to make sure everything is visible and usable. This html pages meta tag also has som additional 
              values to keep the browser widgets to the minimal on mobile devices. The pictures are of both

            'Duckhunt 2' was created by a developer known as 7rip7ych. Though 
            new in the industry, it may ring a bell to the most devoted players 
            of Duckhunt 1. Although 7rip7ych does not specialize in game development, 
            they certainly seem to have a passion for it. Even though the world only 
            sees a new game from 7rip7ych once in a blue moon, it would not be wrong 
            to have high expectations.
